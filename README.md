# NavLink
A LUA-based location (::pos) and autopilot helper for Dual Universe. NavLink is "from scratch" code meant to improve manageability of locations as well as ease of use (ie. Installation). Integration with Archaegeo Orbital Hud is assumed. 

# Pale Horse Aerospace
What would a good gaming project be without a shameless promotion? This project is being undertaken by Cael Voltek, Space Viking & Duck Salesman, as a part of the Pale Horse Aerospace corporation, a subsidiary of Hurstwic Heavy Industries. 

# Where do we start?
Writing has just begun and a first release will be published as soon as the code is "stable". I am looking for anyone that would like to test the code once we get to a "usable" state. I can be contacted via Discord (Cael Voltek#1435).

More info to come as development progresses.
