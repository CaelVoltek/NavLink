# NavLink
A LUA-based bookmark and autopilot helper for Dual Universe. Based on the foundational work by Trog111 and his SatNav project, NavLink is a refactoring of the SatNav code to improve manageability as well as ease of use (ie. Installation). Integration with Archaegeo Orbital Hud is assumed. 

# Pale Horse Aerospace
What would a good gaming project be without a shameless promotion? This project is being undertaken by Cael Voltek, Space Viking & Duck Salesman, as a part of the Pale Horse Aerospace corporation, a subsidiary of Hurstwic Heavy Industries. 

# Where do we start?
Refactoring has just begun and a first release will be published as soon as the code is "stable". I am looking for anyone that would like to test the code once we get to a "usable" state. I can be contacted via Discord (Cael Voltek#1435).

More info to come as development progresses.
